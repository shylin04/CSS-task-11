        <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food.
            The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to
            refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots,
            and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often
            by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are
            fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes,
            flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.<br>
            Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several
            parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life
            developed.
            At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic
            crops from
            elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate
            permits,
            and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations.</p>
